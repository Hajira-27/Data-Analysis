## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, formatting, and normalization  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, trends, and correlations  
- **Visual Insights**: Time-series plots, usage distributions, comparative charts  
- **Key Metrics Extraction**: Average usage time, peak activity periods, user behavior patterns  

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python** – Core programming language  
- **pandas & NumPy** – Data manipulation and numerical analysis  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Visualizing trends and patterns  
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive development environment

Extract meaningful insights

Data Description
Provide a clear description of your dataset:

Column Name	Type	Description
timestamp	datetime	Date and time of usage event
user_id	string	Unique identifier for users
platform	string	Social media platform (e.g., Twitter, TikTok)
duration	numeric	Usage duration (in minutes)
activity_type	string	Type of activity (e.g., post, scroll, comment)

(Adjust these fields to align with your actual dataset.)

Analysis Highlights
Top Platforms: Most-used platforms by total duration

Daily/Hourly Trends: Usage peaks by time of day and day of week

User Behavior: Average session duration, common activity types

Visual Stories: Pair bar charts, line graphs, and heatmaps to highlight insights

Future Enhancements
Automated Reporting: Generate summary dashboards (e.g., via Plotly or Streamlit)

Advanced Analytics: Time-series forecasting, clustering of user behavior

Web App: Deploy a Flask or Streamlit app for interactive data exploration

Clean Architecture: Organize code into scripts/modules for scalability

CI/CD Workflow: Add GitHub Actions for linting/notebook testing
